            I'm <span className="text-secondary">Mantas Valentinaviƒçius</span>,
            and as a web developer, I bring a wealth of knowledge to the table,
            with a focus on TypeScript and JavaScript, as well as expertise in
            top-tier frameworks such as React, Next.js, SCSS, TailwindCSS, and
            Node.js. My passion lies in designing and maintaining responsive
            websites that offer seamless user experiences, and I take pride in
            crafting clean, engaging interfaces through optimized, reusable
            code. With my ability to create and utilize REST APIs and work with
            popular databases like MySQL and MongoDB, I offer a versatile skill
            set that can adapt to any project. As a quick learner and a team
            player, I thrive in group environments where I can learn from others
            and receive valuable feedback on my work.
